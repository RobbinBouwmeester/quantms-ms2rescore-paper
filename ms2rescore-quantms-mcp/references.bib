	The volume of public proteomics data is rapidly increasing, causing a computational challenge for large-scale reanalysis. Here, we introduce quantms (
	https://quant,ms.org/
	), an open-source cloud-based pipeline for massively parallel proteomics data analysis. We used quantms to reanalyze 83 public ProteomeXchange datasets, comprising 29,354 instrument files from 13,132 human samples, to quantify 16,599 proteins based on 1.03 million unique peptides. quantms is based on standard file formats improving the reproducibility, submission and dissemination of the data to ProteomeXchange.},

	The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) is the world’s leading mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data repository and one of the founding members of the ProteomeXchange consortium. This manuscript summarizes the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools for the last three years. The number of submitted datasets to PRIDE Archive (the archival component of PRIDE) has reached on average around 534 datasets per month. This has been possible thanks to continuous improvements in infrastructure such as a new file transfer protocol for very large datasets (Globus), a new data resubmission pipeline and an automatic dataset validation process. Additionally, we will highlight novel activities such as the availability of the PRIDE chatbot (based on the use of open-source Large Language Models), and our work to improve support for MS crosslinking datasets. Furthermore, we will describe how we have increased our efforts to reuse, reanalyze and disseminate high-quality proteomics data into added-value resources such as UniProt, Ensembl and Expression Atlas.},

	This paper describes the pFind 2.0 software package for peptide and protein identification via tandem mass spectrometry. Firstly, the most important feature of pFind 2.0 is that it offers a modularized and customized platform for third parties to test and compare their algorithms. The developers can create their own modules following the open application programming interface (API) standards and then add it into workflows in place of the default modules. In addition, to accommodate different requirements, the package provides four automated workflows adopting different algorithm modules, executing processes and result reports. Based on this design, pFind 2.0 provides an automated target‐decoy database search strategy: The user can just specify a certain false positive rate (FPR) and start searching. Then the system will return the protein identification results automatically filtered by such an estimated FPR. Secondly, pFind 2.0 is also of high accuracy and high speed. Many pragmatic preprocessing, peptide‐scoring, validation, and protein inference algorithms have been incorporated. To speed up the searching process, a toolbox for indexing protein databases is developed for high‐throughput applications and all modules are implemented under a new architecture designed for large‐scale parallel and distributed searching. An experiment on a public dataset shows that pFind 2.0 can identify more peptides than SEQUEST and Mascot at the 1\% FPR. It is also demonstrated that this version of pFind 2.0 has better usability and higher speed than its previous versions. The software and more detailed supplementary information can both be accessed at

	There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

	RESULTS: We present a new tool called MS(2)PIP for predicting the intensity of the most important fragment ion signal peaks from a peptide sequence. MS(2)PIP pre-processes a large dataset with confident peptide-to-spectrum matches to facilitate data-driven model induction using a random forest regression learning algorithm. The intensity predictions of MS(2)PIP were evaluated on several independent evaluation sets and found to correlate significantly better with the observed fragment-ion intensities as compared with the current state-of-the-art PeptideART tool.

However, due to the way peptides are encoded in current prediction models, accurate retention times cannot be predicted for modified peptides. This is especially problematic for fledgling open searches, which will benefit from accurate retention time prediction for modified peptides to reduce identification ambiguity. We present DeepLC, a deep learning peptide retention time predictor using peptide encoding based on atomic composition that allows the retention time of (previously unseen) modified peptides to be predicted accurately. We show that DeepLC performs similarly to current state-of-the-art approaches for unmodified peptides and, more importantly, accurately predicts retention times for modifications not seen during training. Moreover, we show that DeepLC's ability to predict retention times for any modification enables potentially incorrect identifications to be flagged in an open search of a wide variety of proteome data.},

We trained a deep neural network, termed Prosit, resulting in chromatographic retention time and fragment ion intensity predictions that exceed the quality of the experimental data. Integrating Prosit into database search pipelines led to more identifications at {\textgreater}10× lower false discovery rates. We show the general applicability of Prosit by predicting spectra for proteases other than trypsin, generating spectral libraries for data-independent acquisition and improving the analysis of metaproteomes.

We implement MAGE-TAB-Proteomics in a crowdsourcing project to manually curate over 200 public datasets. We also describe tools and libraries to validate and submit sample metadata-related information to the PRIDE repository.

The purpose of this study was to develop a model based on FOX family genes for predicting kidney renal clear cell carcinom (KIRC) prognosis. We downloaded the transcriptional profiles and clinical data of KIRC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) datasets. To build a new prognosis model, we screened prognosis-related FOX family genes using Lasso regression and Multivariate Cox regression analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, a prognostic nomogram was developed using clinical information and selected genes to improve the accuracy of prognostic prediction. We also investigated whether prognosis-related FOX family genes are related to the immune response in KIRC. Finally, we validated the oncogenic role of FOXG1 in KIRC using an in vitro tumor function assay. Six prognosis-related FOX family genes were screened: FOXO1, FOXM1, FOXK2, FOXG1, FOXA1, and FOXD1. The ROC curves indicated that our model was capable of making accurate predictions for 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS). The nomogram further improved the accuracy of prognostic predictions. In addition, compared to those in patients with low-risk scores, high-risk scores predicted a decreased level of immune cell infiltration and a lower immune response rate. Moreover, the results of in vitro studies confirmed that FOXG1 supports the proliferation and invasion of KIRC.},
